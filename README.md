# TO-DO LIST

## High Priority

1. Game start menu / main menu (basic instructions on how to play)
2. Bucket movement/controls
3. Fish and Rock automatic movement
4. Hit detection for when bucket catches a fish
5. Working HUD including health and score
6. Death screen (out of lives / game over)
7. Restart button `R` from keyboard (serial communications)

## Low Priority

1. Make extra obstacle sprites

# Ideas

- For Step 4 instead of constantly moving maybe instead teleporting every few seconds
- For new obstacle maybe it shrinks and grows like a whirlpool or something
- For Bucket maybe it slowly reels back in to make it harder so has to maintain pressing it to stay in place
